1. **Use Responsive Units:** Prefer using percentages, `em`, and `rem` units instead of fixed `px` units to make your layout more flexible.
2. **Media Queries:** Utilize CSS media queries to apply different styles at different screen sizes.
3. **Flexible Images:** Ensure that images scale properly within their containers. You can achieve this with the `max-width: 100%;` CSS rule.
4. **Mobile-First Approach:** Start designing for the smallest screen size and work your way up. This approach helps in creating a more efficient and cleaner codebase.
